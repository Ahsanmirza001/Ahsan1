The derivative of y with respect to x is defined as the change in y over the change in x, as the distance between 
x
0
{\displaystyle x_{0}} and 
x
1
{\displaystyle x_{1}} becomes infinitely small (infinitesimal). In mathematical terms,

f
′
(
a
)
=
lim
h
→
0
f
(
a
+
h
)
−
f
(
a
)
h
{\displaystyle f'(a)=\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}}
That is, as the distance between the two x points (h) becomes closer to zero, the slope of the line between them comes closer to resembling a tangent line.
