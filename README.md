Python map() function

map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)



```
𝑓′(𝑥)=𝑓(𝑥1+Δ𝑥)−𝑓(𝑥1)Δ𝑥

```


```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
