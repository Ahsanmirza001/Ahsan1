# Terminal
## How to open new terminal.
Before you can use it, you need to be able to find it. So what we need to do is open the terminal just press command n.
## First let’s clarify a few terms
# Console: 
This is the system as a whole. This is both the command line as well as the output from previous commands.
## Prompt:
This is the beginning of the command line. It usually provides some contextual information like who you are, where you are and other useful info. It typically ends in a $ . After the prompt is where you will be typing commands.
## Terminal:
This is the actual interface to the console. The program we use to interact with the console is actually a “terminal emulator”, providing us the experience of typing into an old school terminal from the convenience of our modern graphical operating system.

#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.

#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
