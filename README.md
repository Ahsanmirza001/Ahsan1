Before you can use it, you need to be able to find it. So what we need to do is open the terminal just press command n.
## First let’s clarify a few terms
# Console: 
This is the system as a whole. This is both the command line as well as the output from previous commands.
## Prompt:
This is the beginning of the command line. It usually provides some contextual information like who you are, where you are and other useful info. It typically ends in a $ . After the prompt is where you will be typing commands.
## Terminal:
This is the actual interface to the console. The program we use to interact with the console is actually a “terminal emulator”, providing us the experience of typing into an old school terminal from the convenience of our modern graphical operating system.


```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
