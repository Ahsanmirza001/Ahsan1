# What is derivative.
The derivative of y with respect to x is defined as the change in y over the change in x, as the distance between

2. Related Rates
3. Newton's Method
4. Linear Approximations
5. The Mean Value Theorem
## 3. Rules for Finding Derivatives
1. The Power Rule
We start with the derivative of a power function, f(x)=xn
f
(
x
)
=
x
n
. Here n
n
 is a number of any kind: integer, rational, positive, negative, even irrational, as in xπ
x
π
. We have already computed some simple examples, so the formula should not be a complete surprise:
ddxxn=nxn−1

Python map() function

map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)



```
𝑓′(𝑥)=𝑓(𝑥1+Δ𝑥)−𝑓(𝑥1)Δ𝑥

```


```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
